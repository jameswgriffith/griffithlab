\title{Takes a variable on a theta (i.e., standardised or z-score metric) and
converts it to T score (mean = 50, SD = 10 by definition)}
\usage{
theta_to_T(theta)
}
\arguments{
\item{theta}{Values of theta on a z-score metric. theta must be numeric
or coercible to numeric. Factors are not allowed.}
}
\value{
T scores
}
\description{
This function takes theta values on a standardised z-score
metric (i.e., mean = 0, standard deviation = 1 by definition) and converts
it to a T score metric (i.e., mean = 50, standard deviation = 10 by
definition).
